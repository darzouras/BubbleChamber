# Electron Painter

The goal for this Electron project is to create a simple drawing program, similar to an Oekaki board or [Tegaki](http://te2.tewi.us/).

Currently there's not much to do, but I'm trying to add more functionality to it every day. Things that I hope to add to it soon include:
* Further customization of brush tools
* Multiple layers
* Connected community of Users
* Save drawings to your machine
* Post drawings to a personal board or community board

# Getting Started
Getting this program ready to run is super easy:  
* Clone the repository to your machine.  
* Enter the directory and `npm install`.  
* Run via Electron:  
    * On Mac / Linux: `./node_modules/.bin/electron .`  
    * On Windows: `.\node_modules\.bin\electron .`  
    * If Electron is install globally with npm, `electron .`
